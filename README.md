### Sunday: rest & recover
## How do I make them happen?
- **Monday-Saturday:** Don't think about it. Just do it.
  - [“If you’re thinking too much, then you’re not doing enough.”](https://youtu.be/34vRhK6Imw0?si=AS--S1e0fSXAdT7Y)
- **Sunday:** Reflect upon what I did and how I did, updating this README if needed.
