# Physical Health Habits
Putting my sleep, diet, and workout habits in GitHub so I can see how they change over time
## What are they?
### MWF: improve agility & stamina
- 2-mile run (8mph)
- soccer warm-up drills
- soccer stretches
- jiu-jitsu warm-up drills
- 30 leg-raises
### TThSa: improve beauty & strength
- 60 push-ups
- 60 pull-ups
- 60 squats
- 30 leg-raises
### Sunday: rest and recover
## How do I make them happen?
- **Monday-Saturday:** Don't think about it. Just do it.
- **Sunday:** Reflect upon what I did and how I did, updating this README if needed.
